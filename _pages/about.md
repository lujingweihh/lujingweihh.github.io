About me
======
My name is Jingwei Lu (卢经纬). I received the Ph. D. degree in Computer Application Technology from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/), Beijing, China.
My research interests include optimal control, adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and autonomous driving.

Currently, I'm highly interested pre-trained models-powered artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) for optimal control, DRL, and their applications in autonomous driving and motor control.

I'm actively engaged in academic research. I have been serving as a reviewer for various intenational journals and conferences.
Notably, I serve as an Associate Editor of the [IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7274857). I was a Guest Editor of the [IEEE Journal of Radio Frequency Identification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7433271).

At present, I am dedicated to open-sourcing nonlinear optimal control algorithms, including ADP and DRL, and further establishing a tool library of nonlinear optimal control. Please refer to my Repo: [ADPRL](https://github.com/lujingweihh/Adaptive-dynamic-programming-algorithms).

`Besides, I am actively seeking opportunities for visiting scholar, particularly in Labs related to nonlinear optimal control, DRL, and pre-trained models.`
